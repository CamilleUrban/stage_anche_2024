This internship is part of an ongoing thesis entitled ... led by Amélie Gaillard. The reed is a small piece of cut cane wich is set in vibration by the musician's breath, creating a sound. However, for two reeds sold as identical by the manufacturer, single-reed players such as saxophonists and clarinettists are able to perceive a difference and conclude on the quality of the reed. The ultimate goal is to understand what qualifies a reed as good or bad based on its mechanical characteristics. While Amélie Gaillard's thesis links physical and perceptual studies, my contribution aims to provide additional information through the use of artificial intelligence models. The latter will aim to link audio descriptors measured with an artificial musician and mechanical indicators obtained from stiffness bench measurements.
